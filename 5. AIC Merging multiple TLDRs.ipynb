The purpose of the system is to provide expertise in real-time medical diagnosis and support patients in the absence of healthcare workers. The current issue with the healthcare applications that are available globally is the dependency on doctors diagnosis and other medical expertise. The Healthcare Prognosis Interactive System overcomes this inadequacy via an AI-based chatbot and an Application Interface by providing effective means of gathering information, answering general medical queries, providing user assistance specialised for medical purposes and alerting patients on their medication. The HPIS provides an accurate response for 90% of all users’ questions. The device is enabled with a capacity for adaptive learning. For low confidence queries, the bot prompts for additional user inputs and updates its database. The Application Interface integrated with smart pill dispensers is also used to monitor and track the well being of users thus enhancing medication adherence.'\n","introduction1='Healthcare, in-spite of being one of the critical domains of human life, is significantly lagging behind in areas of technological advancement. While e-commerce, retail, and the food industry become more advanced by a range of technological approaches, healthcare often sticks to the conventional way of doing things. The tremendous rise of the aging population around the world in recent years has contributed to a significant rise in health problems, including a rise in chronic diseases and increased expenditure on medical and healthcare [1,2]. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the scope of psychiatric illnesses encompasses depression, paranoia and others including insanity, dementia, learning disability and cognitive disabilities such as autism. Such disorders express themselves in various ways, such as altered feelings, beliefs, attitudes, actions and relationships with others. Depression itself impacts more than 300 million individuals across the world [3]. Even with access to professional health care and support services, people with mental health problems are hesitant to go through therapy because of the stigma of the disease. Given the scarcity of skilled personnel, the challenges to provide satisfactory outcomes is growing exponentially. Monitoring of one’s health plays a significant role in sustaining the wellbeing of a person, particularly the elderly or people with chronic diseases, as this would result in reduced medication and minimal hospitalization. With the rapid expansion in the Healthcare Industry, key stakeholders such as patients and other third-party users are increasingly demanding better services and quality treatment. Healthcare industry leaders and business executives are moving to a wide variety of technological approaches and are now embracing the idea of medical chatbots. Therefore, technological companies are developing Artificial Intelligence-based applications for mobile devices to support the sick, provide assistance to mentally disabled patients and also ensure privacy. Healthcare applications and Medical prognosis chatbots are never going to replace doctors. However, they offer plenty of opportunities to make their job easier and to improve their performance. In this paper, an AI-IoT Based Healthcare Prognosis Interactive System (HPIS) is proposed, with an aim to provide medical support for all individuals. Section I speaks about the need for technological developments in healthcare and its evolution with time. Section II discusses the current global mobile healthcare market along with existing applications. The proposed solution along with its features is described in section III followed by implementation and results in section IV and conclusion in section V.'\n","conclusion1='This paper outlines the working of an AI-IoT based Healthcare Prognosis Interactive System. The system can handle personalised medical requests, book appointments with doctors, provide patients a preliminary diagnosis and acts as a symptom checker thus providing the user with an enhanced quality and quantitative outlook. The user-friendly application allows all age groups, especially the elderly, to easily interact with the system. The main goal of AI-IoT based HPIS is to provide around-the-clock virtual healthcare, reduce the workload of doctors and reduce medical expenditures by improving medication adherence. The chatbot can be considered as a companion for the elderly. The System has built in Security Authentication login features which ensures that the right patient is administered the right medication at the right time.'"],"metadata":{"id":"CRuqIeVZRzC7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#paper2 (in future these will be collected from pdf automatically)\n","title2='WANDA: An End-to-End Remote Health Monitoring and Analytics System for Heart Failure Patients'\n","author2='Mars Lan'\n","abstract2='Recent advances in wireless sensors, mobile technologies, and cloud computing have made continuous remote monitoring of patients possible. In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of WANDA, an end-to-end remote health monitoring and analytics system designed for heart failure patients. The system consists of a smartphone-based data collection gateway, an Internet-scale data storage and search system, and a backend analytics engine for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The system supports the collection of data from a wide range of sensory devices that measure patients’ vital signs as well as self-reported questionnaires. The main objective of the analytics engine is to predict future events by examining physiological readings of the patients. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed analytics engine using the data gathered from a pilot study of 18 heart failure patients. In particular, our results show that the advanced analytic algorithms used in our system are capable of predicting the worsening of patients’ heart failure symptoms with up to 74% accuracy while improving the sensitivity performance by more than 45% compared to the commonly used thresholding algorithm based on daily weight change. Moreover, the accuracy attained by our system is only 9% lower than the theoretical upper bound. The proposed framework is currently deployed in a large ongoing heart failure study that targets 1500 congestive heart failure patients'\n","introduction2='Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world for adults over 65 years of age [1]. Nearly one fourth of the patients treated for HF are re-hospitalized within 30 days, and almost half of them are readmitted within 6 months [2]. These unplanned readmissions are estimated to cost the American healthcare system more than $17 billion annually, or 15% to 20% of the total Medicare expenditure in acute hospital care [3]. To reduce the morbidity, mortality, and economic cost associated with HF, remote health monitoring appears to be a promising solution that can work at scale. However, a major challenge to the realization of a large-scale remote monitoring system is the ability to collect, store, and process the large amount of data gathered from the sensors in an effective, robust, and automated fashion. Furthermore, a truly successful remote health monitoring system should also be able to perform intelligent analysis on collected data. This means the system should provide a wealth of analytical algorithms that can infer useful information or discover predictive patterns from the data. Armed with the information, early interventions can be made to prevent the medical event from happening. Unfortunately, most current remote monitoring systems lack such advanced analytics capabilities. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of WANDA, a remote health monitoring system for HF patients. The system is an end-to-end solution that covers all key aspects of remote health monitoring, from data collection, data storage and access, to data analytics. It also features several auxiliary tools such as an administrative portal, a questionnaire system, and a social network component. The system has been deployed in three heart failure clinical trials over the past 4 years. We also showcase the analytics engine of WANDA by processing real clinical data and generating statistical models. The data for our experimental analysis is based on a pilot trial of 18 heart failure patients. Our analysis shows that the prediction models significantly improve the accuracy of predicting the worsening of HF patients’ symptoms when compared to the traditional thresholding algorithm based on daily weight changes.'\n","conclusion2='In this paper we have introduced the design and implementation of a remote health monitoring system called WANDA. The system is an end-to-end solution comprising three parts: a) a smartphone-based gateway that wirelessly collects data from various sensor-based devices, b) a scalable cloud-based database with a RESTful web interface and PubSub system, and c) an analytics engine capable of prognostic prediction using machine learning and data mining algorithms. Using real data collected from a pilot clinical trial, we have demonstrated the strength of WANDA’s analytics engine by accurately predicting the worsening of HF symptoms in patients. Compared to the commonly accepted predictor of daily weight changes, the algorithms of WANDA analytics engine have identified the 3-day and 7-day fluctuation of blood pressure readings to be highly correlated to the worsening of HF symptoms. As a result, the WANDA analytics engine is able to build prediction models that are up to 74% accurate, which is more than 20% higher than using daily weight change alone. Furthermore, the sensitivity is improved by at least 45% when using these models. Finally, we have shown that the accuracy of the WANDA analytics engine is only 9% lower than the estimated upper bound. The prediction approach presented in this paper is only an example of intelligent analytics that our remote monitoring system offers. In future work, we plan to expand the WANDA analytics engine into several areas beyond predictions, including task optimization, unsupervised learning, individualized health guidance for patients, context-aware prediction, and long-term pattern discovery.'"],"metadata":{"id":"EmUl1MW0STJv"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#paper3 (in future these will be collected from pdf automatically)\n","title3='Chatbot for Disease Prediction and Treatment Recommendation using Machine Learning'\n","author3='Rohit Binu Mathew'\n","abstract3='Hospitals are the most widely used means by which a sick person gets medical check-ups, disease diagnosis and treatment recommendation. This has been a practice by almost all the people over the world. People consider it as the most reliable means to check their health status. The proposed system is to create an alternative to this conventional method of visiting a hospital and making an appointment with a doctor to get diagnosis. This research intends to apply the concepts of natural language processing and machine learning to create a chatbot application. People can interact with the chatbot just like they do with another human and through a series of queries, chatbot will identify the symptoms of the user and thereby, predicts the disease and recommends treatment. This system can be of great use to people in conducting daily check-ups, makes people aware of their health status and encourages people to make proper measures to remain healthy. According to this research, such a system is not widely used and people are less aware of it. Executing this proposed framework can help people avoid the time-consuming method of visiting hospitals by using this free of cost application, wherever they are.'\n","introduction3='A prosperous society is when its entire people are healthy. It is important to maintain the health if one wishes to be happy. Only a healthy body can have a healthy mind and it has a positive impact on the performance of people. Nowadays, people are less aware of their health. In their busy life, they forget to take suitable measures to maintain their health and are less aware of their health status. In the latest news by TOI [1], we can see that people give no importance to their health and find it time consuming to undergo check-ups at hospitals. The busy-scheduled life has got no place for health. Most people comprising the working section of the society claim that their hectic schedule gives them no time for periodic medical check-ups and that they disregard any uneasiness shown by their body until it is too severe. In this proposed system, a medical chatbot is built to be a conversational agent that motivates users to discuss about their health issues and based on the symptoms provided by them; chatbot returns the diagnosis [2]. This chatbot system will be able to identify symptoms from user interaction. Using these extracted symptoms, chatbot predicts the disease and recommends treatment. The machine learning algorithm [3] employed here is K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN). This clearly shows that a medical chatbot can somewhat accurately diagnose patients with simple symptom analysis and a conversational approach done with the help of natural language processing. Medical chatbot has a high impact on the health culture of the state. It has improved reliability and is less prone to human errors. Today‟s people are more likely addicted to internet but they are not concerned about their personal health. They avoid hospital treatment for small issues which may become a major disease in future. This proposed idea solves this problem. This idea focuses on creating a chatbot which is free of cost and available throughout the day. The facts that the chatbot is free and can be accessed wherever the user is, be it their working environment, prompt the user to have it and use it. It saves the overhead involved in consulting specialized doctors. Executing the proposed system can convey more awareness among people regarding their health status and a need to take measures to remain healthy. With the new proposed system, there will be reduction in the number of people disregarding their health because of the tedious process of hospital appointments. People can interact with the chatbot just like they do with another human and can continue with their other works. It ensures that there will be no disruption with their working and is user friendly. This provides a way to help people aware of their health by using the chatbot and thereby helps people with their health, thus playing a bigger role in healthcare.'\n","conclusion3='This paper explains a medical chatbot which can be used to replace the conventional method of disease diagnosis and treatment recommendation. Chatbot can act as a doctor. The chatbot acts as a user application. The user of this application can specify their symptoms to the chatbot and in turn, chatbot will specify the health measures to be taken. General information about symptom and diseases are available in the dataset and thus the chatbot instance can provide information about disease and treatment to the user. After analyzing the symptoms of the different users, it finally predicts the disease to the user and provides with a link where details about the treatment is visible. A smart medical chatbot can be useful to patients by identifying the symptoms as described by them, giving proper diagnosis and providing with suitable treatment for the disease. In the busy life, it is rare for people to frequently visit hospitals for check-ups. Chatbot is of great importance in such situations as they provide diagnostic assistance with a single click of button. Chatbot doesn‟t require the help of any physician to give proper health measures to the users and this is one of the major advantages of chatbot. Moreover, the cost\u0002effectiveness in using chatbot is a major attractiveness to users. The chat with users is completely personal and this helps users to be more open with their health matters and paves way for chatbot to efficiently identify the disease.'"],"metadata":{"id":"zyDbKvFPSgNA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#paper4 (in future these will be collected from pdf automatically)\n","title4='Automatized Medical Chatbot (Medibot)'\n","author4='Prakhar Srivastava'\n","abstract4='Automatized medical chatbots are conversationally built with technology in mind with having the potential to reduce efforts to healthcare costs and improve access to medical services and knowledge. We built a diagnosis bot that engages patients in the conversation for their medical query and problems to provides an individualized diagnosis based on their diagnosed manifestation and profile. Our chatbot system is qualified to identify symptoms from user inputs with a standard precision of 65%. Using these extracted diagnosed symptoms correct symptoms were identified with a recall of 65% and a precision of 71%. Finally, the chatbot returned the expected diagnosis for further more operations. This determines that a medical chatbot can provide a somewhat accurate diagnosis to patients with simple symptom analysis and a conversational approach, this suggests that an effective spoken language medical bot could be viable. Moreover, the relative effectiveness of this bot indicates that more proceeds automated medical products may flourish to serve a bigger role in healthcare.'\n","introduction4='An automatized medical chatbot is a system with human interaction using natural language diagnosis to provide medical aid. The vast amount of information that is available on the internet allows chatbots to provide accurate and systematic statistics based on the user’s demand and requisite. Chatbots are used in domains like Customer Support and Services, Virtual Assistance, Online Trainers, and Online Reservations and also for general conversations. We built a diagnosis bot that engages patients and explains their state using natural language. The bot inquires for relevant particulars, e.g., name, age, etc. and appeal for symptoms. Our bot can withdraw patterns from messages using AIML (Artificial Intelligence Mark-up Language) based on XML (Extensible Mark-up Language) to strengthen AI (Artificial Intelligence) applications [1]. The structure asks progressively more specific questions in order to obtain a good diagnosis. The three primary components of our system are: x recognition and drawing out of symptoms from the discussion with the user. x accurate detection of extracted symptoms to documented symptoms in the database. x developing recognition as well as referring the patient to the most appropriate specialist if necessary. The system was also compared to popular chatbot available. Our motive is to show that the proposed medical Chatbot could be a better alternative to many already existing bots in the domain of medical science.'\n","conclusion4='We advanced in developing an automatized medical chatbot that layout personalized recognition based on symptoms.

Around 15 million human beings have been affected worldwide by more than one mil\u0002lion deaths by covid-19. From the start, the affordability and sustainability of oxygen have been a problem in poor and underdeveloped countries. Oxygen is a very important medicine for treating hospitalized patients with Covid-19. According to PATH, the organization that works with global institutions and businesses to tackle health problems, the demand for Oxygen cylinders has been growing between 6%-8% eacdaily India. When someone gets severe Covid-19, the oxygen levels in the body get low. Patients suffered from enormous fevers, coughs, and lost sense of taste and smell, all of which became problematic when the SARS-CoV-2 virus invaded them. As a result, to prevent such massive prob\u0002lems associated with COVID-19 and facilitate a quick cure method, we have developed a Chatbot that facility an inter\u0002connection between users and computers in a natural manner. In the twenty-first century, artificial intelligence algorithms have been used to create a revolutionary medium with which users can interact with their needs to prevent and resolve acoustic problems easily; one of these is chatbots, a modern form of interaction. Chatbot systems use human interactions such as decision-making performing daily tasks, replying to users quickly, and solving problems like a human. Chatbots are also called communicational agents or answering engines. Developers and programmers train these chatterbots with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to interact with users through voice commands, over commu\u0002nication, or text-based messages. We focused on developing the core of AI to interact more efficiently with users and get to understand the user’s queries, and provide the user with an appropriate solution. This application works in a very simple way because the data is already put in the system. A few things like matching patterns, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and data mining are used in the application to train the system. Chatbots match the user input texts or voices with the previously included data and give replies according to the data. This knowledge or data has been taken from various sources. Everything in this generation is getting in touch with the web. It is effective to use a method to manage to advantage anything at your doorway. AI chatbots can be deployed on the web or in mobile applications as software or on computers. It works 24/7 without any delay, only a good internet connection and power have to provide to work smoothly. Chatbots have a significant role in various fields, especially in the medical field. The first established medi\u0002cal chatbot –ELIZA– was programmed in 1966 to simulate a text-based conversation with a Psychotherapist. The top platform that lends invaluable support to that bot develop\u0002ment, Amazon Alexa, has more than 0.1 million applications, many of which are for health. The ‘World Health Organiza\u0002tion (WHO) on the renowned social media Facebook Mes\u0002senger to counter wrong information and provide accurate information about COVID-19 without any delay, launched a chatbot. As Chatbots are becoming communicational agent in the digital world, it opens many ways for demonstrating a change in behavior for disease prevention and promoting health-related actions on a large scale. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section ‘‘Related Work’’ defines some existing state-of-the-art meth\u0002ods for the AI-assisted Chatbot in health care. Therefore, section-III describes the necessary background of the models that we have used in our research work. The section-IV discusses the proposed algorithm and overall workflow of the proposed AI chatbot system. Then a detailed result analysis and a brief comparison among some popular, highly efficient methods are described in section V. Then, a discussion on the applications and benefits of our proposed model is dis\u0002cussed in section VI and section VII, respectively. Eventually, we conclude the paper in section VIII by highlighting some of the future research scopes.'\n","conclusion5='From this paper, we can conclude that the chatbot is very easy to use for all people; they can use this chatbot in their language. This bot offers medical-related information like doctor’s contact details, address of nearby hospitals, contact details for getting an oxygen cylinder, about the disease its symptoms, its prevalence, diagnosis, and its treatment pro\u0002cedures. We consider that our findings will help researchers to take advantage of the advanced information in the layout and other stuff of these innovative technologies, which may be required for continuous development in the functionality of medical chatbots and may help prevent COVID 19. This medical chatbot has wide future opportunities. People in remote areas can also receive benefits from this. Here we use ‘TensorFlow’, which helps to build the NLP for chatbots and utilizes deep neural network architecture. After building the network for our chatbot, it will predict the correct answers to the user’s queries. Even if it is not in the training model, the bot tries to predict it closer by checking the sentences and their words which will be closer to the training model’s response.'"],"metadata":{"id":"VoCykLwZeMt3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\"\"\"\n","#paper (in future these will be collected from pdf automatically)\n","title=''\n","author=''\n","abstract=''\n","introduction=''\n","conclusion='\n","\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"4S1eU188eyhP","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1697578718062,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Nurshat Fateh Ali","userId":"01142595475851024591"}},"outputId":"9e05d410-2561-4fdd-d3e4-81d34c430727"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"\\n#paper (in future these will be collected from pdf automatically)\\ntitle=''\\nauthor=''\\nabstract=''\\nintroduction=''\\nconclusion='\\n\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["serial=1\n","first=main_function(serial,title1,author1,abstract1,introduction1,conclusion1)\n","first"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":70},"id":"J3tikESER2pA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1697578722128,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":4073,"user":{"displayName":"Nurshat Fateh Ali","userId":"01142595475851024591"}},"outputId":"274e2a55-61f7-4e24-92f9-36b11d4eefb3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (873 > 512).
