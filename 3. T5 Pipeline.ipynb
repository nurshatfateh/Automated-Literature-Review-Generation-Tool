Healthcare Prognosis Interactive System\n","First Author: Joshua Ernest Pedi Reddy\n","Abstract — The implementation of an AI-IoT based Healthcare Prognosis Interactive System is discussed in this paper. The purpose of the system is to provide expertise in real-time medical diagnosis and support patients in the absence of healthcare workers. The current issue with the healthcare applications that are available globally is the dependency on doctors' diagnosis and other medical expertise . The Healthcare Prognosis Interactive System overcomes this inadequacy via an AI-based chatbot and an Application Interface by providing effective means of gathering information, answering general medical queries, providing user assistance specialised for medical purposes and alerting patients on their medication. The HPIS provides an accurate response for 90% of all users’ questions. The device is enabled with a capacity for adaptive learning. For low confidence queries, the bot prompts for additional user inputs and updates its database. The Application Interface integrated with smart pill dispensers is also used to monitor and track the well being of users thus enhancing medication adherence. Keywords — Healthcare, Interactive System, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), Application Interface \n","I. I NTRODUCTION Healthcare, in-spite of being one of the critical domains  of human life, is significantly lagging behind in areas of  technological advancement. While e-commerce, retail, and the food industry become more advanced by a range of technological approaches, healthcare often sticks to the  conventional way of doing things. The tremendous rise of  the aging population around the world in recent years has contributed to a significant rise in health problems, including a rise in chronic diseases and increased expenditure on  medical and healthcare [1,2].  According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the  scope of psychiatric illnesses encompasses depression,  paranoia and others including insanity, dementia, learning disability and cognitive disabilities such as autism. Such disorders express themselves in various ways, such as altered feelings, beliefs, attitudes, actions and relationships with others. Depression itself impacts more than 300 million individuals across the world [3]. Even with access to professional health care and support services, people with mental health problems are hesitant to go through therapy because of the stigma of the disease. Given the scarcity of skilled personnel, the challenges to provide satisfactory outcomes is growing exponentially. Monitoring of one’s  health plays a significant role in sustaining the wellbeing of a  person, particularly the elderly or people with chronic diseases, as this would result in reduced medication and  minimal hospitalization.  With the rapid expansion in the Healthcare Industry, key  stakeholders such as patients and other third-party users are  increasingly demanding better services and quality treatment. Healthcare industry leaders and business executives are moving to a wide variety of technological approaches and are now embracing the idea of medical chatbots. Therefore, technological companies are developing Artificial Intelligence-based ap plications for mobile devices  to support the sick, provide assistance to mentally disabled patients and also ensure privacy. Healthcare applications and Medical prognosis chatbots are never going to replace doctors. However, they offer plenty of opportunities to make their job easier and to improve their performance.  In this paper, an AI-IoT Based Healthcare Prognosis  Interactive System (HPIS) is proposed, with an aim to provide medical support for all individuals. Section I speaks about the need for technological developments in healthcare and its evolution with time. Section II discusses the current global mobile healthcare market along with existing applications. The proposed soluti on along with its features is  described in section III foll owed by implementation and  results in section IV and conclusion in section V.  \n","V.

INTRODUCTION Covid-19 is an ailment because of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. `World Health Organization (WHO)' has been declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Around 15 million human beings have been affected worldwide by more than one million deaths by covid-19. From the start, the affordability and sustainability of oxygen have been a problem in poor and underdeveloped countries. Oxygen is a very important medicine for treating hospitalized patients with Covid-19. According to PATH, the organization that works with global institutions and businesses to tackle health problems, the demand for Oxygen cylinders has been growing between 6%-8% eacdaily India. When someone gets severe Covid-19, The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Shadi Alawneh  .the oxygen levels in the body get low. Patients suffered from enormous fevers, coughs, and lost sense of taste and smell, all of which became problematic when the SARS-CoV-2 virus invaded them. As a result, to prevent such massive problems associated with COVID-19 and facilitate a quick cure method, we have developed a Chatbot that facility an interconnection between users and computers in a natural manner. In the twentyrst century, arti cial intelligence algorithms have been used to create a revolutionary medium with which users can interact with their needs to prevent and resolve acoustic problems easily; one of these is chatbots, a modern form of interaction. Chatbot systems use human interactions such as decision-making performing daily tasks, replying to users quickly, and solving problems like a human. Chatbots are also called communicational agents or answering engines.

Chakraborty et al.: AI-Based Medical Chatbot Model for Infectious Disease Prediction help of arti cial intelligence and machine learning systems to interact with users through voice commands, over communication, or text-based messages. We focused on developing the core of AI to interact more ef ciently with users and get to understand the user's queries, and provide the user with an appropriate solution. This application works in a very simple way because the data is already put in the system. A few things like matching patterns, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and data mining are used in the application to train the system. Chatbots match the user input texts or voices with the previously included data and give replies according to the data. This knowledge or data has been taken from various sources. Everything in this generation is getting in touch with the web. It is effective to use a method to manage to advantage anything at your doorway. AI chatbots can be deployed on the web or in mobile applications as software or on computers. It works 24/7 without any delay, only a good internet connection and power have to provide to work smoothly. Chatbots have a signi cant role in various  elds, especially in the medical  eld. The  rst established medical chatbot \u0015ELIZA\u0015 was programmed in 1966 to simulate a text-based conversation with a Psychotherapist. The top platform that lends invaluable support to that bot development, Amazon Alexa, has more than 0.1 million applications, many of which are for health. The `World Health Organization (WHO) on the renowned social media Facebook Messenger to counter wrong information and provide accurate information about COVID-19 without any delay, launched a chatbot. As Chatbots are becoming communicational agent in the digital world, it opens many ways for demonstrating a change in behavior for disease prevention and promoting health-related actions on a large scale. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section ``Related Work'' de nes some existing state-of-the-art methods for the AI-assisted Chatbot in health care. Therefore, section-III describes the necessary background of the models that we have used in our research work. The section-IV discusses the proposed algorithm and overall work ow of the proposed AI chatbot system. Then a detailed result analysis and a brief comparison among some popular, highly ef cient methods are described in section V. Then, a discussion on the applications and bene ts of our proposed model is discussed in section VI and section VII, respectively. Eventually, we conclude the paper in section VIII by highlighting some of the future research scopes. \n","VIII. CONCLUSION From this paper, we can conclude that the chatbot is very easy to use for all people; they can use this chatbot in their language. This bot offers medical-related information like doctor's contact details, address of nearby hospitals, contact details for getting an oxygen cylinder, about the disease its symptoms, its prevalence, diagnosis, and its treatment procedures. We consider that our  ndings will help researchers to take advantage of the advanced information in the layout and other stuff of these innovative technologies, which may be required for continuous development in the functionality of medical chatbots and may help prevent COVID 19. This medical chatbot has wide future opportunities. People in remote areas can also receive bene ts from this. Here we use `TensorFlow', which helps to build the NLP for chatbots and utilizes deep neural network architecture. After building the network for our chatbot, it will predict the correct answers to the user's queries. Even if it is not in the training model, the bot tries to predict it closer by checking the sentences and their words which will be closer to the training model's response.

Introduction In recent years, there were many people suﬀer from falls which can easily cause serious consequences [1], e.g., plenty of elderly people were seriously injured and most of them are unable to walk anymore, or even some of them lost their lives [2]. Therefore, the entire industry is trying many ways to solve fall detection and even recognize more human behaviors, so as to serve smart medical healthcare [3]. Currently, a human posture recognition system can be utilized to 24/7 monitor the daily behaviors of humans, detect and analyze normal and abnormal postures such as falls and unusual motions. However, identifying human postures more accurately, eﬃciently and intelligently is still a very challenging task in the healthcare industry [4, 5], since it is always impacted by various of internal or external factors. To complete the aim of accurately recognize postures, Matsumoto et al. [6] design a detection system that incorporates multiple sensors such as acceleration, sole pressure sensors. However, it seems low reliability since the adopted framework is heavily relying on the Bluetooth signal strength and manual recording. Manupibul et al. [7] design a smart insole that measures the balance of the foot ∗Corresponding author Email address: xlvision@hotmail.com (Xiaolong Zhou)pressure and detects the balance of the body by deploying a force sensitive resistor (FSR) on the insole.The scenario is interesting, but the relative simple structure limits the usability of the application since only the force and resistance of membrane pressure sensors are used and the pressure distribution is not considered for each speciﬁc motion combination. Furthermore, intelligent information process is another way to enhance the identiﬁcation eﬀectiveness of the system. Without better information process mechanism, we cannot reach the target of accurately recognize human behaviours. Therefore, it not only needs highsensitivity multi-sensors, but also requires more reliable Internet of Things (IoT) network and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) techniques [8], when to achieve smart healthcare. Due to so-called very complicated process, currently, posture recognition still has many challenges, such as how to accurately model the human-being (prone to impact by diﬀerent people, age, actual body situation, etc). We cannot easily deploy the system to complete the high-level human posture recognition. To address all the challenges summarized above in the existing posture recognition system, in this paper, we propose a collaborative AI-IoTbased solution, a wearable-based human posture recognition system, namely, WMHPR, which applies MPR (multiposture recognition) and CACT (Cascade-AdaBoostingCART) algorithm to identify posture more accurately and Preprint submitted to Future Generation Computer Systems July 31, 2021Journal Pre-proofJournal Pre-proof eﬃciently. Furthermore, our WMHPR system has a typical IoT framework that is composed of the node of human (NoH), wireless network and cloud server. Notably, the NoH is embedded with MPR algorithm using oﬄine mode, which is leveraged to determine the posture based on multiple dimensions of collected sensor data. Meanwhile, CACT, an AI-based method, is deployed on the cloud server (i.e., online mode) to further enhance the reliability and accuracy of the whole system so that to compensate for the limitations of oﬄine MPR. In addition, the historical data can help to iteratively updating parameters in MPR using threshold update (TU) algorithm by learning analysis at the cloud server. We conclude the contributions of this paper as follows. 1) Regarding the posture recognition problem, we develop a framework including both the oﬄine and online algorithms with high reliability and outstanding eﬃciency. Particularly, the MPR algorithm for oﬄine recognition could be implemented on wearable hardware with easy setup while the online machine learning algorithm CACT can further enhance the reliability and accuracy of MPR. 2) The proposed WMHPR system with AI-assisted approach covers wide variety of human postures with very high precision rate in diﬀerent IoT scenarios. Comprehensive real-scenario experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and the real-life usability. All the evaluation results demonstrate an outperformed eﬃciency, eﬀectiveness, and reliability of our system. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work is introduced, followed by the WMHPR system design in Section 3. The extraction of feature data, stride frequency calculation with plantar pressure (PSF), oﬄine/online posture recognition (MPR/CACT) and TU algorithms are illustrated in Section 4. Then, we evaluate the experimental results in Section 5. We conclude our work and list future directions in Section 6. \n","6. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we design the WMHPR system using multi-sensors and collaborative AI-IoT-based approach. We also propose MPR and CACT posture recognition algorithm, where MPR is an oﬄine method performed in NoH while CACT is for online human behaviors recognition and judgment under collected data. Indeed, CACT is a powerful complement to the MPR, which enhances the accuracy, eﬃciency and reliability of recognition of human postures, i.e., this scheme further promote the security of the healthcare system. With real-scenarios experiments, the results further prove that MPR obtains total 98.06% TPR and only 0.19% FPR which exceeds other similar algorithms, while CACT also overcomes other typical algorithms and achieves optimal performance with fewer layers and weak classiﬁers. In future work, we will focus on how to further improve our system and its recognition approaches. The main points are needed to consider as follows: 1) How to maintain and improve the accuracy and eﬃciency of recognition algorithms if we reduce the number of sensors (e.g., FSR) while considering the hardware cost. 2) How to eﬀectively recognize many more human postures, especially in extremely similar behaviors. 3) How to evaluate a person in his/her diﬀerent states in diﬀerent periods and make an accurate human model, when considering long-term monitoring to get plenty of corresponding data. Moreover, we will improve the communication frequency and reduce the power consumption to meet the daily needs on the premise of ensuring the quality of wireless communication.

Introduction In modern society, improvements in economic levels and changes in people’s lifestyle patterns attributed to environmental factors have led to the emergence of various metabolic disorders, such as hypertension and diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is a predictor of the risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Compared with healthy groups, the incidence of cardiovascular diseases is higher by approximately 60% in the group of people suffering from metabolic syndrome. Moreover, the risk of diabetes is higher by at least five times [ 1]. In line with the advancement of medical technology, new healthcare methods (exercise therapy, diet, etc.) have been developed in conjunction with a broad range of research for the treatment of diseases. And the cultural phenomenon of proactive wellbeing to promote “living healthier and longer” has led to an increased level of interest in the use of digital healthcare service in the management of the metabolic syndrome. Digital healthcare is a collective term that encompasses all the services provided through the digitalization of processes associated with public health and medical services, such as disease prevention and treatment, medical care, and nursing. In the past, healthcare trends primarily emphasized diagnosis and treatment. However, today’s healthcare trends are shifting towards promoting wellbeing and prevention health [ 2]. With the accumulation of extensive data and advancements in AI, particularly through deep learning, digital healthcare services now possess the potential to predict diseases and complications while offering personalized services accessible at any time and place. This progress in digital healthcare is expected to significantly improve public health [3]. The world has undergone a new paradigm shift over the past 3 years, namely, familiarization with contactless living conditions and the acceleration of digital transformation, Healthcare 2024 ,12, 281. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare12020281 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcare Healthcare 2024 ,12, 281 2 of 10 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of healthcare, various opinions have been reported, and studies have been conducted on the convenience of healthcare services, such as contactless medical treatments and application (app)-based digital healthcare plans [ 4,5]. Meanwhile, in conjunction with infectious diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic and an aging society have emerged as new issues across the globe. As of 2021, the population of senior citizens aged 65 years (or older) in South Korea accounts for 16.5% of the national population. As this population proportion is anticipated to increase steadily to 20.3% by 2025, South Korea is expected to enter a super-aged society era [ 6]. This will lead to a rapid rise in the medical expenses of senior citizens, amplifying the socioeconomic burden. In 2020, individuals aged 65 and over accounted for 43.4% of the total medical expenses, with the medical costs per elderly person being approximately three times higher than those for the general population [ 7]. In other words, an increase in the percentage of the population of senior citizens aged ≥65 years means an increase in medical expenses and the occurrence of socioeconomic issues; hence the necessity for the prevention of chronic diseases. In 2022, the new South Korean Government announced policy tasks which involve the expansion of an artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT)-based healthcare project for senior citizens in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era. In addition, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) (2023), based on its new-year work report, proposed a plan to expand the phases of the AI-IoT-based healthcare project for senior citizens. This is the first public-led contactless healthcare project to provide services by categorizing senior citizens into classes with different weakness levels as part of the plan for smart health support based on life cycle stages. In line with this trend, this study aims to share the recent outcomes of the digital healthcare service for senior citizens which was implemented by the Korea Health Promotion Institute (KHPI) and outlines mid-to-long-term development strategies for this style of South Korean digital healthcare initiatives. \n","3. Conclusions  This study discussed the ﬁeld application of the AI - and IoT-based healthcare project  for senior citizens (which started in the second ha lf of 2020) and related study results and  proposed plans for the diﬀusion of the project.  The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which has been ac celerated as a result of the global  COVID-19 pandemic, introduced numerous changes to o ur society at large. In addition,  internet-based digital technology has revolutionize d our lives. It increases the eﬃciency,  transparency, and convenience of a range of tasks r anging from interactions through com-  munication to ﬁnancial services. Likewise, a data-b ased public health and medical revo-  lution is currently occurring.  Therefore, in the public sector, eﬀort must be expen ded to prepare digital healthcare  strategies including the user-oriented UI and UX up grade for Today’s Health App ® and  improve the eﬃciency and convenience of health-meas uring devices for the health-vul-  nerable class. At the same time, while strengthenin g the capabilities of senior citizens for  self-healthcare and health promotion, it must striv e to provide emotional support using  the screen-type AI speaker and, conﬁgure an environ ment to contribute to the improve-  ment of senior citizens’ quality of life. Based on the results and eﬀects of the project pro-  moted so far, the public sector must develop and im prove public healthcare service poli-  cies through cooperation with private companies.  In addition, there is a need to integrate AI- and I oT-based elderly healthcare manage-  ment services with the existing oﬄine visit-based h ealthcare service model. Furthermore,  active consideration should be given to collaborati on with the welfare sector in order to  provide integrated digital-based integrated care se rvices. In a study by Park Nayeong  (2023), it was highlighted that in order for the el derly to adopt and participate in digital  new technologies in the long term, an integrated op erating system should be established.  This is because a mixed service approach that appro priately mediates face-to-face and  non-face-to-face services has the greatest impact i n terms of eﬀectiveness evaluation, as  the service recipients are similar [20]. In the loc al community, a mixed service approach  combining face-to-face and non-face-to-face service s can increase the participation and  utilization rates of public health management servi ces and, furthermore, provide highFigure 3.

Healthcare 2024 ,12, 281 8 of 10 From another perspective, a new healthcare service using senior towns can be considered. An increasing number of senior citizens who have financial capacity are considering spending their twilight years in senior towns. However, the use of private residential facilities for senior citizens in Korea has not been popularized as these are premium-level facilities and the entry barrier is high. Therefore, as the government needs to focus on the health-vulnerable class, the onset of the era of healthcare services focusing on senior towns is approaching. By recognizing and preparing for the trends of the current times and the paradigm shift in the healthcare field, an efficient public service can be provided for the health-vulnerable class. Moreover, through cooperation with the private sector, the government will be able to offer a broad range of health content services. 3. Conclusions This study discussed the field application of the AI- and IoT-based healthcare project for senior citizens (which started in the second half of 2020) and related study results and proposed plans for the diffusion of the project. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which has been accelerated as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, introduced numerous changes to our society at large. In addition, internet-based digital technology has revolutionized our lives. It increases the efficiency, transparency, and convenience of a range of tasks ranging from interactions through communication to financial services. Likewise, a data-based public health and medical revolution is currently occurring. Therefore, in the public sector, effort must be expended to prepare digital healthcare strategies including the user-oriented UI and UX upgrade for Today’s Health App®and improve the efficiency and convenience of health-measuring devices for the health-vulnerable class. At the same time, while strengthening the capabilities of senior citizens for selfhealthcare and health promotion, it must strive to provide emotional support using the screen-type AI speaker and, configure an environment to contribute to the improvement of senior citizens’ quality of life. Based on the results and effects of the project promoted so far, the public sector must develop and improve public healthcare service policies through cooperation with private companies. In addition, there is a need to integrate AI- and IoT-based elderly healthcare management services with the existing offline visit-based healthcare service model. Furthermore, active consideration should be given to collaboration with the welfare sector in order to provide integrated digital-based integrated care services. In a study by Park Nayeong (2023), it was highlighted that in order for the elderly to adopt and participate in digital new technologies in the long term, an integrated operating system should be established. This is because a mixed service approach that appropriately mediates face-to-face and non-faceto-face services has the greatest impact in terms of effectiveness evaluation, as the service recipients are similar [ 20]. In the local community, a mixed service approach combining face-to-face and non-face-to-face services can increase the participation and utilization rates of public health management services and, furthermore, provide high-quality services by collaborating with the welfare sector. In this context, it is important to consider the elderly’s smartphone specifications, data usage constraints, and network environment to ensure that high-quality healthcare management services are available to the public. Going forward, digital-based healthcare management services are expected to expand further. However, if the economic aspects are not supported by appropriate regulations, health disparities may widen. Therefore, it is important to consider a digital health policy approach from the perspective of health equity.

IoT,   particularly transport, industrial robots and automation systems   are supported by artificial intelligence in a wide range of daily   implementations with dominant industrial applications. IoT is an   interconnected network of physical objects, which enables them to   gather and share information, using software, sensor units and   network connectivity. In industries; IoT brought about a new   revolution in industries. In the field of IoT, the term \"INDUSTRY   4.0” has been used where industrial devices and machines are   connected over the internet and interacting to make decisions via   Artificial Intelligence (M2M communication). This paper focuses   on IoT and AI integration worldwide, addressing current and   future uses for social-value. Keywords—Industrial IoT (IIoT); IoT- based industrial   automation; Internet of robotic things (IoRT); IoT- based robotics. \n","I. I n t r o d u c t io n There are many commonalities among various IoT and AI  systems. Driven by the rapid changes in technology and  significant increase of operational efficiency, several businesses  integrate AI into their IoT systems workflow from Data  improvement, activities automation to final decision making in  relation to machine learning, intelligent reasoning and others. Recently, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has  tremendously provided several machine-to-machine interfaces  for authorized stakeholders to efficiently collect, process,  evaluate and visualize their IoT-connected data and applications.  The advances in both wired and wireless communication and  smart connected devices have a major impact on many IoT  architecture [1]. Previously, both Bluetooth and Radio  Frequency (RF) offered limited connectivity ranges for  monitoring and surveillance in different industrial applications [2]. IoT-based automation has much to offer in this regard [3]. The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview  for the integration possibilities of AI / IoT, focusing on its  implementation in automation and robotics, specifically: a) Outlines an overview of History, present and future of  IoT enabled by AI. b) Presents fundamental issues about the  integration between both of IoT and AI. c) Explains the principles of the \"Industrial Internet of  Things\" (IIoT), \"Industrial Automation Internet ofThings\" (IAIoT), and \"Internet of Robotic  Things\" (IoRT). d) Summarizes a variety of case studies in many industries. e) Summarizes applications of IoT-based robotic. f) Discusses an application of IoT-Based Industrial  Automation. \n","VIII. C o n c lu s io n s Recently, IoT has a major contribution to humanity in many  aspects and multi-disciplinary design as well as complicated and  large-scale systems. The integration with AI has already shown  considerable success. The continuous development along with  many unforeseen beneficial consequences are expected to  revolutionize many industries in the near future. In this paper, I addressed the advent of intelligent things on  the Internet with more capabilities than mere sensors, including Authorized licensed use limited to: University of Cape Town. Downloaded on May 18,2021 at 22:16:15 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.  AI processing and actuation. This makes possible a new Internet  of things that integrated with AI in robotic and industrial  automation applications; such as intelligent agents and  potentially future living beings. IoT enables the successful  management of the facility management, monitoring production  flow, inventory control, logistics, supply chain management and  robotic operations in industrial / robotic automation. While IoT  protection gained significant attention from the beginning, the  approaches which have been developed and used to date have  not been fully successful. In reality the greatest challenges in IoT  and IIoT implementations still remain protection and  confidentiality. Globally, the development of decentralized and multifarious  IoTs is still a challenging procedure. New forms of  interconnectedness, interrelation, and interdependence need to  be developed for IoT-based solutions alongside shared and  collaborative resources. The ethical aspects and standards of  both IoT and AI systems and applications have to be considered  in the actual practice and implementations [19 - 25].
